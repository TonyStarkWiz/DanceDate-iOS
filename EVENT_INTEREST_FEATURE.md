# Event Interest Feature

## Overview
The "I'm Interested" button allows users to express interest in dance events. This feature enables:

- **Event Discovery**: Users can mark events they're interested in
- **Social Matching**: Find other users interested in the same events
- **Notifications**: Get updates about events they're interested in
- **Personal Dashboard**: View all events they've shown interest in

## Implementation

### UI Components
- **Interest Button**: Heart icon with "I'm Interested" text on each event card
- **Visual Feedback**: Success alert when interest is recorded
- **Event Actions**: Button layout with interest and external link options

### Backend Services
- **EventInterestService**: Handles CRUD operations for event interests
- **Firestore Collection**: `event_interests` stores user interest data
- **Security Rules**: Users can only access their own interests

### Data Model
```typescript
interface EventInterest {
  id: string;           // userId_eventId
  userId: string;        // User who showed interest
  eventId: string;       // Event they're interested in
  eventTitle: string;    // Event title for quick reference
  eventInstructor: string; // Event instructor
  eventLocation: string; // Event location
  eventSource: string;   // Source of event (API, Firestore, etc.)
  interestedAt: Date;    // When interest was recorded
  eventData?: DisplayableEvent; // Full event data
}
```
